I would like to continue our discussion whether we
can measure the angular frequency to better
than the Heisenberg limit, in case
of a quantum-mechanical oscillator.
So the question is, can you measure the frequency
of a quantum-mechanical harmonic oscillator in the time Delta-T
to an accuracy which is better than the limit of Heisenberg's
Uncertainty.  Ok - your vote, please.
