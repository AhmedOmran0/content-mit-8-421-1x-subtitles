But I think we have at least understood
in the adiabatic limit is that when
we start with a magnetic moment, which is aligned,
and now we do a sweep, we start with a small rotating frequency
and we make it large.
We sweep from low to high frequency through resonance.
Then we can invert the magnetic moment.
My question for you now is what happens
when we start with a spin, but we
switch on a drive which is far above resonance,
and we sweep it to small frequencies?
What will now happen when we do the opposite sweep?
Will the spin just stay?
Will it be flipped, or will it sort of get diffused,
or get disoriented?
So this is answer A, this is answer B,
and this is answer C. I have assumed in the discussion
before that we start with a very low frequency, where
the fictitious magnetic field is negligible,
and then we change the frequency,
we sweep the frequency across the normal frequency
to very high frequency.
My question now is what happens when we reverse
the frequency of the sweep?
