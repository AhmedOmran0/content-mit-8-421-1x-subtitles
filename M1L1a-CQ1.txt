OK.
So I want you to think about some seemingly simple
questions.
The first question is whether the uncertainty-- delta
omega times delta t larger than 1/2--
does this uncertainty hold for purely classical systems?

So we now assume we have a purely classical-- you can even
think a mechanical, large mechanical object-- purely
classical harmonic oscillator.
You can observe it for time delta t.
Or it oscillates for time delta t.
Can you determine its frequency, better than this uncertainty suggests,
