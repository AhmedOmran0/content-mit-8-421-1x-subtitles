Well, let me then immediately add another twist.
What would happen-- let's ask the same question,
but now we are driving it at a lower frequency.

OK, same question as before, but instead of driving this system
with a faster rotating field, faster than the Larmor
frequency, we're now driving it with a smaller frequency.
Is now the response of the magnetic moment--
the effective precession frequency-- larger, smaller,
or the same as the Rabi frequency as the resonant case?
