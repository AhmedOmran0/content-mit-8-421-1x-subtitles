Now, instead of a quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator,
we take something to be a very familiar with, an optic laser,
and we observe a laser pulse lasting a duration delta t.
So, same situation.
But, instead of observing a quantum mechanical harmonic
oscillator, we observe the laser pulse.
For the laser can remeasure the frequency
