Since it is so important, let me ask you a clicker question,
whether this Hamiltonian can be exactly realized in nature,
or it is an approximation?

For instance, let-- you always have cosine omega t
as a drive and cosine omega t is e to the plus i omega t and e
to the minus omega t.
And then maybe with a rotating wave approximation we
throw away a term. So I sort of want
to ask you, is this an idealization that we have
a coupling which is a simple, complex exponential?
Is nature always more complicated?
Or is there a simple way to realize
this Hamiltonian in nature?
